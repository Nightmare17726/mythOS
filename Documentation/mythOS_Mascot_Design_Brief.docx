mythOS MASCOT DESIGN BRIEF
Professional Design Specifications for Mythology-Themed Operating System Mascots

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PROJECT: mythOS - Lightweight Linux Distribution for Obsolete Hardware
TARGET: WebDT 366 Tablets (64-128MB RAM, 128-256MB storage)
PURPOSE: Mascot-guided user experience across 5 themed editions

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
═════════════════

The mythOS mascot system combines mythology-inspired characters with practical user
guidance. Each mascot serves as both a visual identity for their edition and an
interactive assistant that helps users navigate their system. Designs must balance
professional quality with resource constraints - mascots appear in:

• Low-resolution displays (800x600, potentially lower)
• Limited color depth (16-bit color)
• Constrained storage (images must be optimized, <500KB each)
• Various UI contexts (boot screen, help dialogs, system notifications)
