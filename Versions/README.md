# mythOS - Versions
As stated on the home page for this project, the plan is to have multiple different versions (found in the Versions folder) for different target audiences. If you download one of the VirtualBox virtual machines, the username should be: `mythOS vX.X` and the password is: `mythOS`. The different versions of mythOS include:

* Hydra
* Nekomata
* Dragon
* Pegasus

# Hydra Version
The Hydra version of mythOS is intended for Students of varying diciplines (namely Computer Science though). This version will include tools similar to Wireshark, John the Ripper, etc. that are designed to help students comlpete whatever task they need. This version will also provide more information provided on the GUI than other versions, and can be daunting to the unexperienced.

# Nekomata Version
This version is for those who want to use mythOS as their daily operating system. Basic tools such as word processing, email, web browsing, etc. will be installed.

# Dragon Version
This is the version intended for gamers. Little more than gaming drivers and programs (namely STEAM) will be installed in this version of mythOS.

# Pegasus Version
The Pegasus version of mythOS is designed for Simplicity. The purpose of this version is to allow those who do not know how to use computers effectively to safely and properly complete basic tasks - similar to the Nekomata version. There will be more custom prompts providing assistance during setup, and desktop-icons to bring those instructions back incase they are needed.
