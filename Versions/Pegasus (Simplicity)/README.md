# mythOS - Pegasus Version
The Pegasus version of mythOS is designed for Simplicity. The purpose of this version is to allow those who do not know how to use computers effectively to safely and properly complete basic tasks - similar to the Nekomata version. There will be more custom prompts providing assistance during setup, and desktop-icons to bring those instructions back incase they are needed.
