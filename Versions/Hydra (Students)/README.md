# mythOS - Hyrda Version
The Hydra version of mythOS is intended for Students of varying diciplines (namely Computer Science though). This version will include tools similar to Wireshark, John the Ripper, etc. that are designed to help students comlpete whatever task they need. This version will also provide more information provided on the GUI than other versions, and can be daunting to the unexperienced.
