# mythOS

The repository for a pet project of ours: mythOS (name pending).

The vision for this project is a fully customized Linux operating system built for anyone! Different versions for students, gamers, daily users, the elderly, the young, etc. Different versions will have different detaults, themes, installed programs, prompts, etc. We plan to get some assistance from looking at other successful Linux distros, as well as consulting the Linux From Scratch, and other documentation while creating a stable build that everyone can enjoy.

There are additional directories, documentation, and historical information available in this Git for project documentation purposes. Information on the development of the GUI can be found in the Potential GUIs directory. Additionally, programs that our team has either created or edited can be found in the Programs directory.

If you are interested in downloading a copy of mythOS for yourself, please see the Versions directory and download the version you would like. For more information, please read our Project Proposal in the Documentation directory of this repositorty, as well as the "README.md" files that can be found in the majority of the other directories. Thank you for your interest in mythOS!
